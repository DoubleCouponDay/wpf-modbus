# wpf-modbus
Example application of a WPF HMI connected to an Arduino Uno With Wifi R3.

## Setting up 

Wifi is relayed through the ESP8266. Program the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE with the following steps:

- Add the following Board Manager to the IDE:

    http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

- Install the esp8266 Board Manager.

## Calculations (based on Arduino Servo Library)

    min pulse width = 544
    max pulse width = 2400

    servo min = min pulse width - (min pulse width * 4)
    => -1632 //not sure why the arduino servo library is calculating this as negative

    servo max = max pulse width - (max pulse width * 4)
    => -7200

    servo angle âˆˆ [0 deg, 180 deg]
        eg: 90 deg

    servo min < pulse width < servo max

    clock cycles per microsecond = 16 * 10^6 / 1 * 10^6
    => 16
    
    //on time
    on pulse width = (servo max - servo min) / (180 - 0) * servo angle + servo min
    => -4416

    on pulse width = on pulse width - 2
    => -4418

    on frequency = clock cycles per microsecond * on pulse width / 8
    => -8836

    on time = abs(1 / on frequency) //I used abs because the negative period didn't make sense to me
    => 113.17338 * 10^-6
